# Quiz Forge

Kahoot-style realtime trivia with AI-generated quizzes. A host creates a lobby, enters a topic, chooses quiz length, and the server uses OpenAI to generate strict JSON multiple-choice questions. Players join from their phones with a room code and play timed rounds over WebSockets.

## Stack

- Node.js + npm
- Express + Socket.IO
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- OpenAI Responses API
- Vitest + Testing Library

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy the example env file and add your OpenAI key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run the app in development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`

## Environment

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
PORT=3001
QUESTION_DURATION_MS=15000
RESULT_DURATION_MS=4000
NEXT_ROUND_DELAY_MS=2500
LEADERBOARD_DURATION_MS=5000
```

- `NEXT_ROUND_DELAY_MS` controls the short countdown before the next question starts.
- `LEADERBOARD_DURATION_MS` controls how long the final leaderboard stays on screen before the waiting state.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` starts Vite and the Socket.IO server together
- `npm test` runs the full test suite
- `npm run build` builds the client and compiles the server
- `npm start` runs the compiled production server

## Notes

- Lobby state is in memory only.
- Restart reuses the generated quiz payload and resets scores.
- A full server restart clears active lobbies.
